## PHP 7 introduction

This tutorial is a living document and will be updated when new features are added to PHP 7 or more good other resources are
available elsewhere.

PHP 7 is the next major version of PHP <strike>programming</strike> general purpose scripting language. Choosing the version 7 was
voted and chosen because of the lots of fake existing books that was mentioning PHP 6 long before the next version even existed
and to avoid confusion PHP 7 was chosen. Gutman said "We're going to skip [version] 6 because years ago, we had plans for a 6 but
those plans were very different from what we're doing now", so name PHP 7 was chosen.
