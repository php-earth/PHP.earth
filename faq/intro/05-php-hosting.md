For a web application to work out of your localhost environment you usually choose a hosting service provider with a server.

One of the most asked questions is "Are there any good free providers for decent hosting of your PHP application?".

In short there are but unfortunately you will meet many issues with that. There is hardly anything completely free available
around you. Same goes to web hosting.

Free hosting limitations:
- traffic quota limit
- server resources quota limit
- php extensions and functionality limitations
- forced injected advertisements

Types of web hosting services and commonly used termins:

Shared hosting

Shared web hosting service or virtual hosting service is a service where lot of websites are hosted on the same webserver and server's
resources (RAM, disk and processor) are shared among the users. Also PHP settings are usually the same for all websites.

VPS

VPS or virtual private server is a next step in hosting service. It is a bit more pricey but no other users share your package. VPSes
can get dedicated amount of RAM, disk and processor speed so your application if already a step to gain more freedom in settings and
customizations.

Dedicated server

Dedicated server means an entire server - machine is for you. More resources, and more disk quota is available that way. Price can be highest that
way.

Cloud hosting

This is latest trend in web hosting services.

Do yourself and your application's audience a favour and invest a bit into your hosting infrastructure. Stability and aviability of
your application will depend on that big time.
