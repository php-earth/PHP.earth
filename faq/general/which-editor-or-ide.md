Most of your time choosing a right tool for the job is important. So is picking the editor or IDE (integrated development environment) in
which you will write, edit, debug and test your code and spend a lot of your time.

There are many open-source and proprietary text editors and IDEs available on the market today. Difference between editor and IDE is in
functionalites and extensions that IDE holds over a plain text editor. Many editors have capabilities to be extended to a full IDE as well.
IDE has more features than editor but also takes more resources on your computer.

Also following and looking up to other good developers and/or teammates in your company what they use for writing code is a good approach for you to choose an editor.

Listing tools always leads to flamewars between users using them convincing each other to "buy" theirs. We're not trying to start a flamewar here
but to only show some of the good tools you should check out for your development and pick the right one for you. If we've missed any let us know.
