    <div class="panel callout radius" style="margin-top: 50px"><img src="/assets/img/octocat.png" alt="Octocat" />Go to GitHub, fork
    the <a href="https://github.com/wwphp-fb" rel="nofollow">wanted project</a>, send pull request and get yourself on the list of
    contributors as well.</div>

    <strong>Contributing procedure</strong>

    <p>Before contributing to any open source project on GitHub get yourself familiar with <a href="/faq/git-introduction/">Git version
    control system usage</a> and how to use <a href="https://help.github.com/">GitHub</a>.<p>

    <p>GitHub provides also built in editor on GitHub so editing content should be quite simple. You will get used to it in no time.
    Otherwise below is also a more general forking and committing changes procedure with Git and GitHub which gives you more control
    over your changes.</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Fork wanted project from <a href="https://github.com/wwphp-fb" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a></li>

        <li>Setup your local environment:
            {% highlight bash %}$ git clone git@github.com:your_username/php-faq.git{% endhighlight %}
        </li>

        <li>Set up your repository and set a remote branch for future updates:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/wwphp-fb/php-faq.git
$ git config branch.master.remote upstream
{% endhighlight %}

        That way you can update your repository (when the upstream gets updated) and automatically pull upstream commits:

        {% highlight bash %}$ git pull{% endhighlight %}
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Verify that you have all the latest commits available
            {% highlight bash %}$ git log --oneline -3{% endhighlight %}
            
            Cross-check the topmost commit log with the one in main repository and make sure everything is in sync.
        </li>
        

        <li>Create a new Git branch for instance patch-1:
            {% highlight bash %}$ git checkout -b patch-1{% endhighlight %}

            This ensures that your repository will not need rebasing when the upstream gets updated.
        </li>

        <li>Commit and push to your GitHub repository
{% highlight bash %}$ git add .
$ git commit -m "my new changes"
$ git push origin{% endhighlight %}
        </li>

        <li>Send a pull request</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Send suggestions for micro events</h3>

    <p>Every week or two we have special topics to gain more exposure or more thorough discussions about topics that are either important for PHP community or the group in general. Micro events are pinned on top of the group until the next micro event occurs. You are welcome to send your suggestions and open a ticket at GitHub <a href="https://github.com/wwphp-fb/wwphp-fb.github.io" rel="nofollow">wwphp-fb.githu.io repository</a>.</p>
